#+TITLE: CHJ Hartgerink (life's work)
#+OPTIONS: num:nil

I do not like presenting my life's work (=CV=), but some people or
organisations keep asking for it, so I keep track here. It's likely to
be incomplete.

# If you want to find out more about my philosophy to how I spend my energy, please read about that here.

If you decide to contact me because you like my work, please do that
via [[mailto:chris@libscie.org][this e-mail]]. I currently reside in Berlin (DE) most of the time
and speak English, Dutch, and German natively or fluently.
